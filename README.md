# about
* [le-vim] Early 1989 people using PE2, I used an editor QE (Qedit) more advance P->Q  :-), later TSE Pro, which is faster highly customizable via SAL. our colleague using BRiEF for BiOS development so I try to learn and clone the features on TsePRO (atags/vgrep...) meanwhile put more feature on BRiEF I'm few use on this editor. I'm enjoy for those porting lot of potential have been port (Emacs/ViM/JED/FED/CRiSP/Epsilon/MultiEdit/Boxer/Aurora/Jasspa...[macro]) finally using FTE as my fav editor when I moving to linux environment.

* lot of people ask there have BRiEF Compatible Editor for Linux, CRiSP is, how about TsePRO ... all PC DOS editor is heavy Alt/Meta key I founded [FTE] is good using ncurses and other console library simple and open source ViM/Emacs are not friendly coming from windows. but every editor have the interest point can not be clone (size/features/keybinding/dialogBox...) and work flow.

* Implement feature near 10 yrs now I'm in for daily using because  ..... just like windows is far away linux become strong and strong, using many year of TsePRO there are silence 10 years and FTE no people keep maintain only ViM and Emacs keep continue ... 

* [neovim] vim refactor

* [le-evil] le-evil haha great work I've vim+emacs+... but why rectangle-operation can not like evil mode "C-v" for visual select ??
