[le-vim] Early 1989 people using PE2, I used an editor QE (Qedit) more advance P->Q  :-), later TSE Pro, which is faster highly customizable via SAL. our colleague using BRiEF for BiOS development so I try to learn and clone the features on TsePRO (atags/vgrep...) meanwhile put more feature on BRiEF I'm few use on this editor. I'm enjoy for those porting lot of potential have been port (Emacs/ViM/JED/FED/CRiSP/Epsilon/MultiEdit/Boxer/Aurora/Jasspa...[macro]) finally using FTE as my fav editor when I moving to linux environment.

[tips] lot of people ask there have BRiEF Compatible Ediot for Linux, CRiSP is, how about TsePRO ... all PC DOS editor is heavy Alt/Meta key I founded FTE is good using ncurses and other console library simple and open source ViM/Emacs are not friendly coming from windows. but every editor have the interest point can not be clone (size/features/keybinding/dialogBox...) and work flow.

[vim] Implement feature near 10 yrs now I'm in for daily using because the powerline(airline) ??
